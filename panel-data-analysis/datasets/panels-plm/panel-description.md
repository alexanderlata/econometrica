The variables l* (lcrmrte, lprbarr, ...) contain the pre-computed logarithms of the base variables as found in the original data set. Note that these values slightly differ from what R’s log() function yields for the base variables. In order to reproduce examples from the literature, the pre-computed logs need to be used, otherwise the results differ slightly.
